# 🔐 Real Time Password Strength Analyzer

A modern cybersecurity-themed password security analyzer built using **React, FastAPI, and Python** that evaluates password strength in real time using:

- Character diversity analysis
- Entropy estimation
- Sequence detection
- Repetition analysis
- Randomness simulation
- Risk prediction logic

Designed to simulate practical password attack risks and promote secure authentication practices.

# 🔍 How It Works

The analyzer performs multiple layers of password auditing:

1. Detects character diversity
2. Measures password length
3. Calculates entropy estimation
4. Simulates randomness
5. Detects predictable sequences
6. Detects repeated patterns
7. Calculates security score
8. Predicts real-world cracking difficulty
9. Generates security recommendations

# 📈 Security Rating System

| Score Range | Strength Level |
|---|---|
| 80–100 | Very Strong |
| 60–79 | Strong |
| 40–59 | Medium |
| 20–39 | Weak |
| Below 20 | Very Weak |

---

# 🧠 Risk Prediction Levels

| Risk Level | Estimated Crack Time |
|---|---|
| Low Risk | Days/Weeks |
| Moderate Risk | Hours/Days |
| High Risk | Minutes/Hours |
| Critical Risk | Seconds/Minutes |
